**QUIZZER**

**DECRIPTION**
This project is a command line application built with Python. The quiz has 10 general knowledge multiple choice questions which makes it easy for users to choose from. The quiz lets the users know when they have chosen the correct answer and will also let the user know when they've got the answer wrong. The users score is returned to them at the end of the quiz, and given the option to play again if they wish.
